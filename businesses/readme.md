# Data Rights Protocol for Businesses

Are you overwhelmed by CCPA requests?  Do you want to get ahead of automated Authorized Agent tools?  Want to do the right thing for consumers but also get your time back? 

**The [Data Rights Protocol](https://datarightsprotocol.org) is a free and open source standard solution that can help you manage this challenge.**

* The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requires businesses to provide consumers with certain rights regarding their personal data, including the right to know what personal data is being collected about them, the right to request that their personal data be deleted, and the right to opt out of the sale of their personal data.

* The Data Rights Protocol (DRP) is a new way for businesses to process requests from Authorized Agents on behalf of consumers. The DRP helps businesses stay in compliance with the CCPA while providing a faster, cheaper, and better method of processing these requests.

* We have set up a Covered Business Group your company can join to stay abread of the DRP, have influence on future development of the DRP, and be the first to be able to test and deploy DRP as a solution to the challenge of processing Authorized aAent requests.

* By joining the Covered Business Group and using the Data Rights Protocol, businesses will be able to stay in compliance with the CCPA while enjoying a faster, cheaper, and better method of processing requests from Authorized Agents.
